ABOUT

Casalimpia Cleaning Services, founded in 2003 by Yeimy Rosas and
her mother, began as a part-time house cleaning venture in Mary
Esther, Niceville, and Shalimar. Over time, the business expanded,
incorporating residential, home, office cleaning, and maid services.
Client satisfaction fueled growth, with word-of-mouth referrals driving
their success in Northwest Florida.
The founders transitioned to full-time operation, naming the company
'Casalimpia,' meaning 'Clean House' in Spanish. They broadened their
service area to include Fort Walton Beach, Destin, and surrounding
areas, while also expanding their cleaning team.
Casalimpia continued to add services, including comprehensive home
cleaning and maid options. They prioritized thorough training for all
staff to ensure consistent, high-quality service. Client happiness
remained their top priority, fostering a family-like work environment
with long-term employee retention. Many of their original cleaners
have remained with the company for over a deca

SERVICES

First Time Cleaning

In-depth cleaning is
recommended if your home
hasn’t been serviced for more
than two months. Every nook
and cranny will be scrubbed,
wiped, and dusted. We would
spend extra time removing any
build up of dirt, dust, and mold
in bathrooms and the kitchen.
Feel the difference when you
live in a home that’s free from
dust mites, allergens, and other
respiratory hazards. 90 % of our
first time cleaning requires the
top to bottom cleaning.

Recurring Cleaning

Once a house has been serviced
with a first time cleaning, it will
be put into great shape with a
recurring cleaning .
Recurring cleaning is offered on
a weekly, biweekly or monthly
basis. (We also offer customized
clean for those services not
listed. for example, 2-3 times a
week).
After 6 weeks of no service,
most homes need a first time
cleaning again.

Move In/Out Cleaning

Whether you’re moving in or
moving out, you would want to
focus more on the transition
process rather than the process
of cleaning up. We want to help
you make moving day less
hectic by handling your cleaning
activities so you can settle in or
move out of your home for less
stress!
